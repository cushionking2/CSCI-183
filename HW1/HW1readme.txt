//HW1 - By Austin Wang and Aditya Ranade

For Problems 1, 3, 4, and 6 in the Python for Data Science portion of HW1, we ran it through Jupyter Notebook on our local machine, 
with the data files in the same folder as HW1. We have also submitted screenshots of the output of these problems to show that the 
file read successfully. All the problems are in HW1 .ipynb and can be ran in JupyterNotebook on your local machine with the data files 
in the same folder.
